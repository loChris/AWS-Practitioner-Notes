AWS SSL Server Certificates, which are also called AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) SSL/TLS certificates, are a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to easily provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates for use with AWS services and your own applications running on AWS infrastructure. Here's a rundown of its key features:

- **Managed Service**: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is a fully managed service provided by AWS, meaning that AWS takes care of the complexity of certificate provisioning, renewal, and deployment. This allows you to focus on building and running your applications without worrying about managing SSL/TLS certificates.

- **Free SSL/TLS Certificates**: ACM provides free SSL/TLS certificates for use with AWS services such as Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon API Gateway. These certificates are automatically provisioned and managed by ACM, and there is no additional cost for using them.

- **Custom SSL/TLS Certificates**: In addition to free certificates, ACM allows you to import and manage your own custom SSL/TLS certificates for use with your applications running on AWS infrastructure. You can import certificates purchased from third-party certificate authorities (CAs) or generated using your own certificate authority.

- **Automatic Renewal**: ACM automatically handles certificate renewal and reissuance to ensure that your certificates remain valid and up-to-date. ACM monitors the expiration dates of your certificates and automatically renews them before they expire, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

- **Integration with AWS Services**: ACM integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, such as Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon API Gateway. You can easily associate ACM SSL/TLS certificates with these services to secure your web applications, APIs, and content delivery networks.

- **Secure and Private**: ACM securely stores your SSL/TLS certificates in the AWS Key Management Service (KMS), ensuring that they are encrypted at rest and protected from unauthorized access. You can control access to your certificates using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.

- **Global Availability**: ACM is available in multiple AWS regions around the world, allowing you to provision and manage SSL/TLS certificates close to your users for low-latency and high-performance connections.

AWS SSL Server Certificates, provided by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), simplify the process of provisioning, managing, and deploying SSL/TLS certificates for securing your web applications, APIs, and content delivery networks running on AWS infrastructure. With ACM, you can easily obtain free SSL/TLS certificates, import your own custom certificates, and ensure that your certificates remain valid and up-to-date with automatic renewal.
