### Ami

**AMI**: Are templates of pre-configured EC2 instances, which allow you to quickly launch a new EC2 instance based on the configuration defined within the AMI.

It's an image baseline that includes an OS and applications, along with any custom configs.

You can even purchase Vendor created AMIs or community AMIs from the marketplace.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Instance Types

**Instance Types**: Defines the size of the instance based on a variety of parameters such as:
* vCPUs: number of virtual CPUs on the instance
* Architecture: The processor architecture, such as i386, x86, or ARM
* Memory: GiB RAM
* Storage: GB
* Storage Type: HDD/SSD
* Network Performance: Shows us performance level or rate of data transfer

These can be divided into:
* **General Purpose:**
	* A balanced mix of CPU, memory, and storage
	* Ideal for small to medium databases, test and development environments, or web servers.
* **Compute Optimized:**
	* Focus on compute power
	* Ideal for applications requiring high performance processors, such as batch processing or machine learning
* **Memory Optimized:**
	* Primarily used for large-scale enterprise class in-memory applications, such as performing real-time processing of unstructured data
* **Accelerated Computing:**
	* Utilizes hardware accelerators or co-processors to perform floating-point calculations faster and more efficiently
* **Storage Optimized:**
	* Optimized for enhanced storage
	* SSD-backed instance storage for low latency and very high input/output or I/O performance, including very high IOPS (Input/Output Operations)
	* Useful for data file systems and log processing applications
* **HPC Optimized:**
	* Designed for high performance computing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Instance Purchasing Options

**Instance Purchasing Options**:
* **On-Demand Instances:** EC2 instances that you can launch at any time, for as long as you need with a flat hourly rate depending on the type of instance you choose. Useful for development or testing environments.
* **Spot Instances:** Leverage unused EC2 capacity to provide discounts for on-demand pricing based on supply and demand. Only suitable for applications or operations that are resilient to interruptions.
* **Reserved Instances:** An on-demand instance for a set period of time. This is ideal for long-term and predictable workloads. Must be purchased in either one-year or three-year commitments. Can save some money by paying the whole cost upfront.
* **On-Demand Capacity Reservations:** Reserve capacity based on attributes such as instance type and platform within an availability zone for any length of time. This means no billing discounts, but you can create and cancel these reservations at any time. For additional savings, combine On-demand capacity Reservations with Reserved instances or with EC2 instance savings plans.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Tenancy

**Tenancy**: EC2 offers different tenancy options for hosting your instances:
- **Shared Tenancy**: Instances run on shared physical hardware, along with instances from other AWS customers. This is the default tenancy option and is suitable for most workloads.
- **Dedicated Instances**: Instances run on hardware dedicated to a single AWS account, providing isolation from instances belonging to other accounts.
- **Dedicated Hosts**: Physical servers are dedicated to a single AWS account and can be used to launch instances with specific configurations, including specific instance types and operating systems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
### User Data

**User Data**: User data allows you to customize the configuration of your EC2 instances during launch. You can provide a script or commands in the form of user data, which will be executed when the instance starts up. This enables you to automate tasks such as software installation, configuration, and bootstrapping.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Storage Options

**Storage Options**: EC2 instances can be configured with various storage options to meet the needs of different workloads:
- **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**: Persistent block storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances. EBS volumes are suitable for data that requires durability and can be detached and reattached to different instances.
- **Instance Store Volumes**: Temporary storage volumes that are directly attached to the host machine. Instance store volumes provide high-performance storage but are not persistent; data is lost when the instance is stopped or terminated.
- **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Object storage service that can be accessed from EC2 instances over the internet. S3 is suitable for storing large amounts of data and is often used for static website hosting, data backup, and content distribution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Security

**Security**: EC2 provides various features to enhance the security of your instances:
- **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to your instances. You can define rules to allow or deny traffic based on IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Network Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Optional layer of security that operates at the subnet level, allowing you to control traffic at a higher level than security groups.
- **Key Pairs**: EC2 uses key pairs for SSH authentication to secure access to Linux instances. You can generate key pairs and associate them with instances during launch, allowing you to securely connect to your instances using SSH.
