Cloud Computing is a remote virtual pool of on-demand shared resources offering Compute, Storage, Database and Network services that can be rapidly deployed at scale.

**Virtualization**: It allows the possibility of having multiple VMs, each running essentially a separate OS and applications, installed on 1 physical server.

**Compute**: objects provide the 'brains' to process your workload - so CPU/RAM.

**Storage**: resources allow you to save and store your data - your storage drives.

**DB**: resources allow you to store structured sets of data used by your apps.

**Network**: resources provide the connectivity allowing all other resources to communicate with each other.
