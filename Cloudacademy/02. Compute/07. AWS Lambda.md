AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. Here's a brief overview of its key features:

- **Serverless Computing**: Lambda follows a serverless computing model, where you can upload your code and AWS takes care of provisioning and managing the infrastructure needed to execute it. You don't need to worry about server maintenance, scaling, or capacity planning.

- **Event-Driven Execution**: Lambda functions are triggered by events from various AWS services, such as changes to data in Amazon S3, updates to Amazon DynamoDB tables, HTTP requests via Amazon API Gateway, and many others. You can also schedule functions to run at specific intervals using Amazon CloudWatch Events.

- **Support for Multiple Runtimes**: Lambda supports multiple programming languages and runtimes, including Node.js, Python, Java, Go, .NET Core, and Ruby. You can write your code in your preferred language, and Lambda handles the execution environment for you.

- **Pay-Per-Use Pricing**: With Lambda, you only pay for the compute time consumed by your functions, measured in milliseconds. There are no upfront costs or minimum fees, and you don't pay for idle resources. This pay-per-use pricing model can result in significant cost savings, especially for sporadically used workloads.

- **Automatic Scaling**: Lambda automatically scales your functions in response to incoming requests or events. It provisions additional execution environments as needed to handle concurrent invocations, ensuring that your functions can handle varying levels of traffic without manual intervention.

- **Integrated Logging and Monitoring**: Lambda integrates with Amazon CloudWatch to provide logging and monitoring for your functions. You can view execution logs, monitor performance metrics such as invocation count and duration, and set up alarms and notifications for important events.

- **Built-in High Availability and Fault Tolerance**: Lambda runs your functions across multiple Availability Zones within a region, providing high availability and fault tolerance out of the box. If one Availability Zone experiences issues, Lambda automatically reroutes traffic to healthy instances in other zones.

AWS Lambda simplifies the process of building and deploying event-driven applications and microservices, allowing you to focus on writing code and delivering value to your users without worrying about infrastructure management.
