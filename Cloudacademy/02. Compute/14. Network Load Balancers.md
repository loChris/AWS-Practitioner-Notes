Network Load Balancers (NLBs) are a type of load balancer provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that efficiently distribute incoming network traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model. NLBs are designed to handle high volumes of traffic and provide ultra-low latency, making them ideal for use cases that require high-performance and scalability. Here's a rundown of their key features:

- **Layer 4 Load Balancing**: NLBs operate at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model, allowing them to route traffic based on IP address and port information. This enables NLBs to handle both TCP and UDP traffic and efficiently distribute traffic across multiple targets.

- **Ultra-Low Latency**: NLBs provide ultra-low latency and high throughput, making them ideal for latency-sensitive applications and high-performance workloads. NLBs are designed to handle millions of requests per second with minimal latency, ensuring that your applications can handle high volumes of traffic without degradation in performance.

- **Connection-Based Routing**: NLBs use a connection-based routing algorithm to route incoming traffic to targets. NLBs maintain a persistent connection between clients and targets, ensuring that subsequent requests from the same client are routed to the same target, which helps improve performance and reduce latency.

- **IP Address Preservation**: NLBs preserve the source IP address of the incoming request when forwarding traffic to targets, allowing your applications to see the original client IP address. This is particularly useful for applications that require client IP address information for logging, security, or regulatory compliance purposes.

- **High Availability and Fault Tolerance**: NLBs are highly available and fault-tolerant, with built-in redundancy and automatic failover across multiple Availability Zones. NLBs monitor the health of targets and automatically reroute traffic away from unhealthy targets to healthy ones, ensuring high availability and reliability.

- **Integration with AWS Services**: NLBs seamlessly integrate with other AWS services, such as EC2, Auto Scaling, and AWS Lambda. You can easily attach NLBs to your EC2 instances or Auto Scaling groups to distribute incoming traffic, and use NLBs to invoke Lambda functions in response to network requests.

- **TLS Termination**: NLBs can terminate SSL/TLS encryption and decryption at the load balancer, reducing the computational overhead on your backend servers and improving performance. NLBs support multiple SSL/TLS termination options, including SSL passthrough and SSL termination at the load balancer.

- **Centralized Logging and Monitoring**: NLBs provide centralized logging and monitoring through integration with Amazon CloudWatch. You can view metrics such as connection counts, throughput, and error rates in real-time, set up alarms and notifications for important events, and analyze access logs to troubleshoot issues and optimize performance.

Network Load Balancers (NLBs) are a high-performance and scalable load balancing solution that efficiently distribute incoming network traffic across multiple targets at the transport layer. NLBs provide ultra-low latency, high availability, and fault tolerance, making them well-suited for use cases that require high-performance and scalability, such as web applications, APIs, and microservices architectures.
