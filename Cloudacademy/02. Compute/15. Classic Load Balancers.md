Classic Load Balancers (CLBs) are a type of load balancer provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that distribute incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses. CLBs operate at both the application layer (Layer 7) and the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model, allowing you to route traffic based on application-level attributes or network-level information. Here's a rundown of their key features:

- **Layer 4 and Layer 7 Load Balancing**: CLBs support both Layer 4 (TCP/SSL) and Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) load balancing, allowing you to distribute traffic based on IP address and port information (for Layer 4) or application-level attributes such as HTTP headers, URL paths, and query strings (for Layer 7).

- **Application-Level Routing**: CLBs allow you to define routing rules based on application-level attributes, such as HTTP headers, URL paths, and query strings. This enables you to create sophisticated routing rules to route traffic to different backend services based on the content of the request.

- **Network-Level Load Balancing**: CLBs use a connection-based routing algorithm to distribute traffic across multiple targets. CLBs maintain persistent connections between clients and targets, ensuring that subsequent requests from the same client are routed to the same target, which helps improve performance and reduce latency.

- **SSL/TLS Termination**: CLBs can terminate SSL/TLS encryption and decryption at the load balancer, reducing the computational overhead on your backend servers and improving performance. CLBs support multiple SSL/TLS termination options, including SSL passthrough and SSL termination at the load balancer.

- **Session Stickiness**: CLBs support session stickiness, allowing you to route requests from the same client to the same target for the duration of the session. This ensures that session-related data, such as shopping carts or user sessions, is maintained across multiple requests and routed to the same backend server.

- **Health Checks and Auto-Scaling**: CLBs perform health checks on targets to monitor their health and availability. If a target becomes unhealthy, CLBs automatically reroute traffic away from the unhealthy target to healthy ones. CLBs also integrate with Auto Scaling to automatically scale the number of instances in response to changes in traffic demand.

- **Integration with AWS Services**: CLBs seamlessly integrate with other AWS services, such as EC2, Auto Scaling, and Route 53. You can easily attach CLBs to your EC2 instances or Auto Scaling groups to distribute incoming traffic, and use CLBs with Route 53 for DNS-based load balancing and failover.

Classic Load Balancers (CLBs) are a versatile and reliable load balancing solution that allow you to distribute incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets based on application-level attributes or network-level information. CLBs help improve the availability, fault tolerance, and scalability of your applications by evenly distributing traffic and automatically routing requests to healthy targets.
