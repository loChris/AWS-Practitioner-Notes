### AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)
**AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)** enables you to migrate relational databases, nonrelational databases, and other types of data stores.

With AWS DMS, you can move data between a source database and a target database. The **source and target databases** can be of the same type or different types. During the migration, your source database remains operational, reducing downtime for any applications that rely on the database.

For example, suppose that you have a MySQL database that is stored on premises in an Amazon EC2 instance or in Amazon RDS. Consider the MySQL database to be your source database. Using AWS DMS, you could migrate your data to a target database, such as an Amazon Aurora database.

### Other use cases for AWS DMS
#### Development and Test Database Migrations
Enabling developers to test applications against production data without affecting production users.
#### Database Consolidation
Combing several databases into a single database.
#### Continuous Replication
Sending ongoing copies of your data to other target sources instead of doing a one-time migration.
