To learn more about the role of subnets within a VPC, review the following example from the coffee shop:

First, customers give their orders to the cashier. The cashier then passes the orders to the barista. This process allows the line to keep running smoothly as more customers come in.

Suppose that some customers try to skip the cashier line and give their orders directly to the barista. This disrupts the flow of traffic and results in customers accessing a part of the coffee shop that is restricted to them.

To fix this, the owners of the coffee shop divide the counter area by placing the cashier and the barista in separate workstations. The cashier's workstation is public facing and designed to receive customers. The barista's area is private. The barista can still receive orders from the cashier but not directly from customers.

This is similar to how you can use AWS networking services to isolate resources and determine exactly how network traffic flows.

In the coffee shop, you can think of the counter area as a VPC. The counter area divides into tow separate areas for the cashier's workstation and the barista's workstation. In a VPC, **subnets** are separate areas that are used to group together resources.
### Subnets
A subnet is a section of a VPC in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs. Subnets can be public or private.

![[Pasted image 20240415194242.png]]

**Public subnets** contain resources that need to be accessible by the public, such as an online store's website.

**Private subnets** contain resources that should be accessible only through your private network, such as a database that contains customers' personal information and order histories.

In a VPC, subnets can communicate with each other. For example, you might have an application that involves Amazon EC2 instances in a public subnet communicating with databases that are located in a private subnet.
### Network Traffic in a VPC
When a customer requests data from an application hosted in the AWS Cloud, this request is sent as a packet. A **packet** is a unit of data sent over the internet or a network.

It enters into a VPC through an internet gateway. Before a packet can enter into a subnet or exit from a subnet, it checks for permissions. These permissions indicate who sent the packet and how the packet is trying to communicate with the resources in a subnet.

The VPC component that checks packet permissions for subnets is a **network access control list (ACL).**
### Network ACLs
A network ACL is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.

For example, step outside of the coffee shop and imagine you are in an airport. In the airport, travelers are trying to enter into a different country. You can think of the travelers as packets and the passport control officer as a network ACL. The passport control officer checks traveler's credentials when they are both entering and exiting out of the country. If a traveler is on an approved list, they are able to get through. However, if they are not on the approved list or are explicitly on a list of banned travelers. they cannot come in.

Each AWS account includes a default network ACL. When configuring your VPC, you can use your account's default network ACL or create custom network ACLs.

By default, your account's network ACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic, but you can modify it by adding your own rules. For custom network ACLs, all inbound and outbound traffic is denied until you add rules to specify which traffic to allow. Additionally, all network ACLs have an explicit deny rule. This rule ensures that if a packet doesn't match any of the other rules on the list, the packet is denied.
### Stateless Packet Filtering
Network ACLs perform **stateless** packet filtering. They remember nothing and check packets that cross the subnet border each way: inbound and outbound.

When a packet response for that request comes back to the subnet, the network ACL does not remember your previous request. The network ACL checks the packet response against its list of rules to determine whether to allow or deny.

![[Pasted image 20240415195258.png]]

After a packet has entered a subnet. it must have its permissions evaluated for resources within the subnet, such as Amazon EC2 instances.

The VPC component that checks for packet permissions for an Amazon EC2 instance is a **security group.**
### Security Group
A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon EC2 instance.

![[Pasted image 20240415201127.png]]

By default, a security group denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic. You can add custom rules to configure which traffic should be allowed; any other traffic would then be denied.

For this example, supposed that you are in an apartment building with a door attendant who greets guests in the lobby. You can think of the guests as packets and the door attendant as a security group. As guests arrive, the door attendant checks a list to ensure they can enter the building. However, the door attendant does not check the list again when guests are exiting the building.

If you have multiple Amazon EC2 instances within the same VPC, you can associate them with the same security group or use different security groups for each instance.
### Stateful Packet Filtering
Security groups perform **stateful** packet filtering. They remember previous decisions made for incoming packets.

Consider the same example of sending a request out from an Amazon EC2 instance to the internet.

When a packet response for that request returns to the instance, the security group remembers your previous request. The security group allows the response to proceed, regardless of inbound security group rules.

With both network ACLs and security groups, you can configure custom rules for the traffic in your VPC.
