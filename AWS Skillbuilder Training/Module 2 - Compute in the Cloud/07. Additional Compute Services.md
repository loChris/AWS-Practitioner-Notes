### Serverless Computing
The term "serverless" means that your code runs on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers. With serverless computing, you can focus more on innovating  new products and features instead of maintaining servers.

Another benefit of serverless computing is the flexibility to scale serverless applications automatically. Serverless computing can adjust the applications' capacity by modifying the units of consumptions, such as throughput and memory.

An AWS service for serverless computing is **AWS Labmda**.
#### AWS Lambda
**AWS Lambda** is a service that lets you run code without needing to provision or manage servers.

While using AWS Lambda, you pay only for the compute time that you consume. Charges apply only when your code is running. You can also run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. all with zero administration.
##### How AWS Lambda Works:
![[Pasted image 20240415131745.png]]
* You upload your code to lambda
* Set your code to trigger from an event source, such as AWS services, mobile applications, or HTTP endpoints
* Lambda runs you code only when triggered.
* You pay only for the compute time that you use.
#### AWS Fargate
**AWS Fargate** is a serverless compute engine for containers. It works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. (see below for containers, ECS, and EKS)

When using AWS Fargate, you do not need to provision or manage servers. AWS Fargate manages your server infrastructure for you. You can focus more on innovating and developing your applications, and you pay only for the resources that are required to run your containers.
### Containers
**Containers** provide you with a standard way to package your applications code and dependencies into a single object. You can also use containers for processes and workflows in which there are essential requirements for security, reliability, and scalability.
### Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
**Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)** is a highly scalable, high-performance container management system that enables you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS.

Amazon ECS supports Docker Containers. **Docker** is a software platform that enables you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. AWS supports the use of open-source Docker Community Edition and subscription-based Docker Enterprise Edition. With Amazon ECS, you can use API calls to launch and stop Docker-enabled applications. 
### Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
**Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** is a fully managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS.

**Kubernetes** is open-source software that enables you to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. A large community of volunteers maintains Kubernetes, and AWS actively works together with the Kubernetes community. As new features and functionalities releases for Kubernetes applications, you can easily apply these updates to your applications managed by Amazon EKS.
