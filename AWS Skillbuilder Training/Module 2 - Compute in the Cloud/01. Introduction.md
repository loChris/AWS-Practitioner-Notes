### Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
Amazon EC2 provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

**Scenario**: Image you are responsible for the architecture of your company's resources and need to support new websites. With on-prem resources you would have to:
* Spend money upgront to purchase needed hardware
* Wait for the servers to be delivered to you
* Install the servers in your physical data center
* Make all the necessary configurations
With an Amazon EC2 instance you can use a virtual server to run applications in the AWS Cloud.
* You can provision and launch an EC2 instance within minutes
* You can stop using it when you have finished running a workload.
* You pay only for the compute time you use when an instance is running, not when it is stopped or terminated
* You can save costs by paying only for server capacity that you need or want
