### Monolithic Applications
Applications are made of multiple components. The components communicate with each other to transmit data, fulfill request, and keep the application running.

Suppose that you have an application with tightly coupled components. These components might include databases, servers, the user interface, business logic, and so on. This type of architecutre can be considered a **monolithic application.**

In this approach to application architecture, if a single component fails, other components fail, and possibly the entire application fails.

### Microservices
In a **microservices** approach, application components are loosely coupled. In this case, if a single component fails, the other components continue to work because they are communicating with each other. The loose coupling prevents the entire application from failing.

When designing applications on AWS, you can take a microservices approach with services and components that fulfill different functions. Two services facilitate application integration: **Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)** and **Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS).**

### Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
**Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)** is a publish/subscribe service. Using SNS topics, a publisher published messages to subscribers. This is similar to the coffee shop; the cashier provides coffee orders to the barista who makes the drinks.

In SNS, subscribers can be web servers, emails addresses, AWS Lambda functions, or several other options.
### Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
**Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)** is a messaging queuing service.

Using SQS, you can send, store, receive messages between software components, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available. In SQS, an application sends messages into a queue. A user or service retrieves a message from the queue, process it, and then deletes it from the queue.
