These devices offer different capacity points, and most include built-in computing capabilities. AWS owns and manages the Show Family devices and integrates with AWS security, monitoring, storage management, and computing.
#### AWS Snowcone
**AWS Snowcone** is a small, rugged, and secure edge computing and data transfer device.

It features 2 CPUs, 4GB of memory, and up to 14 TB of usable storage.
#### AWS Snowball
**AWS Snowball** offers two types of devices:
* **Snowball Edge Storage Optimized*** devices are well suited for large-scale data migrations and recurring transfer workflows, in addition to local computing with higher capacity needs.
	* Storage: 80TB of hard disk drive (HDD) capacity for block volumes and Amazon S3 compatible object storage, and 1TB of SATA solid state drive (SSD) for block volumes
	* Compute: 40 vCPUs, and 80GiB of memory to support Amazon EC2 sbe1 instances (equivalent to C5).
* **Snowball Edge Compute Optimized** provides powerful computing resources for use cases such as machine learning, full motion video analysis, analytics, and local computing stacks.
	- Storage: 80-TB usable HDD capacity for Amazon S3 compatible object storage or Amazon EBS compatible block volumes and 28 TB of usable NVMe SSD capacity for Amazon EBS compatible block volumes.Â 
    - Compute: 104 vCPUs, 416 GiB of memory, and an optional NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. Devices run Amazon EC2 sbe-c and sbe-g instances, which are equivalent to C5, M5a, G3, and P3 instances.
#### AWS Snowmobile
**AWS Snowmobile** is an exabyte-scale data transfer service used to move large amounts of data to AWS.

You can transfer up to 100 petabytes of data per Snowmobile, a 45-foot long ruggedized shipping container, pulled by a semi trailer truck.
